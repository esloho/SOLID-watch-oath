# The SOLID's Watch Oath

Code gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no multiple responsibilities, hold no hard-wired dependencies, father no unsubstitutable childs. I shall wear no general interfaces and win no unused methods. I shall open for extension and close for modification. I am the refactor in the darkness. I am the watcher on the patterns. I am the shield that guards the realm of tests. I pledge my life and honor to the SOLIDâ€™s Watch, for this code and all the code to come.
